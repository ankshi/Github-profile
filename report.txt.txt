First I downloaded the zip file git-task2 from moodle and extracted the files to desktop .
 Here I used 
      cd c
      cd users
      cd user
      cd desktop
      cd git-task2
to access the files / directories

Now , to trace the commit where the creds.env is added , I used

      git log --name-status
Then I created a new branch named erase from the prevous commit of which creds.env was added using the command
      
      git checkout -b erase <hash of the previous commit>
 
to restore the files from the commit where creds.env was added , i used
    
      git restore --source=<hash of the commit>

and now i created a commit .gitignore using

      touch .gitignore
then i went back to desktop and opened the folder git-task2 and then opened the file .gitignore and typed " *creds.env"

then back to ubuntu
I added the files README.md and .gitignore to the staging area using 

       git add README.md .gitignore
 then commited the files using the msg ignore
  
       git commit -m "ignore"

and then checked the status using 

       git log --name-status

then i switched to the branch master using
       
       git checkout master
 
and checked for the status .
then switched to the branch erase
and checked for the status
then I rebased the head 
 
       git rebase --onto <hash of current head> <hash of commit X>

 and the finally to remove the dangling branch  I used
       
       git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all
       git gc --prune=now
